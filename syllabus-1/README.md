# Syllabus 1

Include Solution code, reading material and resources for 10days in syllabus 1.

## Note:
I primarily code in **C++**, but I will try to write equivalent code in **Python** too.

If you cannot find Python code for any problem in this folder then try the link in this README where I have attached solution links for Python code.
